# MAVLink Generator (`mavgen`)

This directory contains the MAVLink library and scripts to automatically generate it from MAVLink definitions.

In order to run it, you will need [Python and some other libraries installed](https://mavlink.io/en/getting_started/installation.html).

Then, run the appropriate script (`generate.sh` for Linux, `generate.bat` for Windows) to automatically re-generate the library.
